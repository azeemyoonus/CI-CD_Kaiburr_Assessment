This is a simple Task Management web application with a backend built using Java Spring Boot and a frontend developed with Next.js and Material-UI. It allows users to perform various tasks such as creating tasks, deleting tasks, and searching for tasks based on different criteria.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate the build process and a Docker build for containerization.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI/CD workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](https://github.com/azeemyoonus/Kaiburr-Assessment/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml). The workflow consists of two jobs: one for building Docker  and another for Nextjs app build.
